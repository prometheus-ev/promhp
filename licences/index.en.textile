The  p r o m e t h e u s  image archive is a broker that brings together an array of diverse databases. The image holders put their databases at disposal free of charge for use in research and education.


The license fees are used exclusively to cover the expense arising from running, managing, and improving the image archive. The association  p r o m e t h e u s  e.V. ("gemeinn√ºtziger Verein") is decidedly non-commercial.
