There are different ways to use prometheus. We offer the following license models for you:

h3. Campus license

With a campus license all members of a university can use prometheus from any computer within the campus network. Additionally, they may obtain personal accounts for added benefit.

h3. Institutional license

Smaller institutions and single university departments can obtain an institutional license. The institutional license fees are staggered by the size of the institution.

h3. Single license

If you can't use prometheus through a licensed institution you can obtain a single license.
