Institutions and schools which hold a license or participate in a campus license may ask at the prometheus office for an *administrative account* free of charge.

Once you got an administrative account, please note the following: As an administrator you are authorized to assign personal accounts to teachers, researchers, and students at your institution. You are fully responsible for the allocation and management of the personal accounts you assign.

The administrative account should be managed - if possible - by a member of staff. Teachers, researchers, and students apply to you for a personal account.
