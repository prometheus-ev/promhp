*We would like to upload our pictures in prometheus. What are the first steps?*
First of all you create an own database.

Then there are several possibilities how your database can be uploaded.
1. Please send us a XML-dump with the contents and the image files and we reserve your data on the prometheus-Server.
2. You provide us with a XML-dump with the contents but keep the image files on your own server. In this case you are responsible for the access to your own server.
Further possibilities and options can be acquired through our office.
see "Information for database suppliers":<%=r 'databases' %>
*Attention!!* prometheus offers the database system DILPS to interested institutes free of charge in order to create an own database. Please apply for an account in our office.
Your images are uploaded automatically after a DILPS database is provided.
For the picture production please follow our recommendations:
see Infosheet "Image reproduction: Scan" - "download: tools - reference manuals (eikonline 2)":<%=r 'tools/manuals/eikonline-2' %>

*We intend to digitalize our slides. Is that recommended?*
Basically it is not recommended, because most slides were photographed from books. A digital image is often much better. Only original slides with views and objects which are not found in books should be scanned.
