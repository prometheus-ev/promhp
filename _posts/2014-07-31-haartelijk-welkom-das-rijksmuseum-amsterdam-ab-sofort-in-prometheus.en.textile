The Dutch national museum offers with its large collection a representative overview of Dutch art and history from the Middle Ages onwards, and of major aspects of European and Asian art. 

With 'Rijksstudio' the museum makes a large part of its collection available to all, providing high-resolution images. Furthermore this is also offered for integration in other contexts by the Rijksmuseum API. This is why we decided to now also integrate the "Rijksmuseum Collection":<%=p 'source/open_access/amsterdam_rijksmuseum' %> as Open Access database in prometheus.
We're grateful for this enrichment!

Enjoy discovering!
