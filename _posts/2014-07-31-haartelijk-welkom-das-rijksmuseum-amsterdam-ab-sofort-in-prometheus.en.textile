The Dutch national museum offers with its large collection a representative overview of Dutch art and history from the Middle Ages onwards, and of major aspects of European and Asian art. 

With 'Rijksstudio' the museum makes a large part of its collection available to all, providing high-resolution images.

Enjoy discovering!
