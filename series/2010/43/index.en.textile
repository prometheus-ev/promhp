The ideal of a pure and unsophisticated art connected Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Erich Heckel and Max Pechstein. They developed the "Viertelstundenakt", a working method, which coerces the artists to sketch the essential in only 15 minutes, because the model remains in the same posture for a short term only. Besides they tried to find untrained models, for example children like the two girls Fränzi and Marcella, who act naturally, even if they are in a studio of an artist.
