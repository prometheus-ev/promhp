*"Photography is a picture-language;*

*the only language that can be understood anywhere in the world."* Andreas Feininger (1906-1999) discovered this language and became a famous photographer with his pictures of architecture and detailed nature studies. An exhibition in Friedrichshafen is showing almost 300 photos as an overview of his lifework. *Andreas Feininger. That's Photography, 24. Sept. 2010 - 9. Jan. 2011, Zeppelin-Museum Friedrichshafen*
