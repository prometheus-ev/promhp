The main focus of an exhibition in Münster is the studio as a working space. Around 160 exhibits, including canvas, drawings, prints and sculptures, are showen. On one hand You'll find pictures of Picasso, reflecting the work as an artist, showing a studio, an artist and his muse. On the other hand there are objects like trial proofs or original pallets showing parts of the working process. The exhibition is completed with a series of photos by David Douglas Duncan (they show Picasso painting), and the movie "Le Mystére Picasso" by Henri-Georges Clouzot.
