prometheus enables the convenient search for images on a common user surface within "different image archives":http://prometheus.uni-koeln.de/pandora/en/source/list, variable databases from institutes, research facilities and museums. Do you have interesting image files? Why don't you offer them to sciences, research and studies. 
Are you interested in building up your own, external database? We provide the use of "DILPS":http://prometheus-bildarchiv.de/tools/databases/dilps and in the future of the "imeji":http://www.kunstgeschichte.hu-berlin.de/2012/03/imeji-community/ database software. 
Inside the image archive you have the opportunity to upload your personal images to your "own database":http://prometheus.uni-koeln.de/pandora/en/upload/list.
