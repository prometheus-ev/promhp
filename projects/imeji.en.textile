h3. Project description

imeji is a scientific image management application for scholars who want to save their images on the web, but also maintaining the corresponding metadata and its values, for data completeness. The software offers a dedicated metadata management by supporting a non- restrictive metadata schema definition, as simple as liked or as complex as needed.
