h3(#usage). Utilisation of the image archive

h4(#use). How can I use the image archive?

The image archive can be used with an inexpensive license.

h4(#anyone). Can anyone use the image archive?

You can use the image archive via a single license for 30 €/year, which can be payed via the e-payment service PayPal.
It's also possible to pay the amount on account. In this case an additional fee of 15 € will be calculated.

*Attention!*
Please check our "list of licensees":<%=p 'institution/licensed' %>. Possibly you belong to one of the institutions listed. This enables you to apply for a free account for the image archive.

In both cases you can register "here":<%=p 'signup' %>.

h4(#institution). As an institution, how can we use the image archive?

You can either apply for an institute license or a campus license.
The fee is based on the size of your institute. ("license fees":<%=r 'license/fees' %>)
To receive a license please contact the Hochschulbibliothekszentrum (HBZ). ("inhalte@hbz-nrw.de":mailto:inhalte@hbz-nrw.de). For an IP-connection and the authorization of the administration to use your personalized account please contact our office. ("info@prometheus-bildarchiv.de":mailto:info@prometheus-bildarchiv.de)

h4(#campus). What is a Campus account?

The IP-address of the respective computer of the University is activated so research can be done online.

h4(#home). Can I use the image archive at home?

Yes the image archive can be used either with a personalized account with a "user name" and a pin or you can log on to the University network and then use the campus account to log-in the image archive.

h4(#denied). What can I do when the access gets denied in spite of a personalized account and the right pin?

First you need to check if your user name and your pin is correct. Did you watch the case sensitivity?
If you do not remember your pin, please use the 'Forgot your password?'-Button: "Reset password":<%=p 'password' %>.

h4(#ip). The campus account is denied in spite of the activation of the IP-field. What can I do?

Please check the activated IP with our office.
Ask your computer center if there is an intermediary Proxy-server. If so, have it activated also and please, pass on the information to our "office":mailto:info@prometheus-bildarchiv.de.

h4(#login). I am not able to log-in to prometheus, although my college has a campus account according to the list of licensees. What is responsible for that problem?

That could be due to either your working on a computer that is not part of the college network, for example your own computer at home or possible problems occurred during the release of the IP addresses of your college.

In the first case you can get a personalized account via the "Sign up"-button on our homepage. In the latter case please inform the administrators at your college computer center. Please refer to our "help page":<%=p 'help/login#problems' %> for additional information.

h3(#tools). Use of single tools

h4(#download). How I can download an image from prometheus?

With a repeated click you can enlarge the image you found in the image archive and then store it onto your computer by right mouse click.

h4(#show). I want to show images from prometheus on my private web site in the Internet. May I do that?

For the most part, no. You may show images without copyrights only on your web site.
This affects, however, only the images, on which the utilization rights of the artist's work (starting 70 years after the death of the artist) are not touched anymore or the ancillary copyright of a photographer on the photograph (off 50 year after its appearance) is not affected.
Otherwise the rights have to be obtained from the authors and/or the VG Bild-Kunst always.

h4(#printing). Can I use image files from prometheus for the printing of my doctoral thesis?

For the most part, no. You may use images with no copyrights only.
This affects, however, only the images, on which the utilization rights of the artist's work (starting 70 years after the death of the artist) are not touched anymore or the ancillary copyright of a photographer on the photograph (off 50 year after appearance) is not affected.
Otherwise the rights have to be obtained from the authors and/or the VG Bild-Kunst always.

h4(#use-images). Can I use image files from prometheus for examinations, term papers and M.A. theses?

Yes, you may, as long as they are exclusively used for your unpublished studies.

h4(#google). I like to search in google. What are the disadvantages?

Most images in google have a bad quality or the legend with the images is not correct.

h4(#domains). Why is it that in some domains many images can be found in prometheus, but not in others?

prometheus itself does not have any images, it is dependent on the image databases that supply the images. In spite of the existing variety there are still many gaps. If you have relevant images or know an important image database, please inform our "office":mailto:info@prometheus-bildarchiv.de! We will be glad to include them.

h4(#quality). Why is the quality of the images so different?

The quality of the images is only as good as they come from the image databases from the institutes, research projects, museums and archives. If you come across a very bad image please inform the responsible project person by mail.

h4(#collection). What is an image collection?

In an image collection you can file and sort out images to further use in a presentation. The image collection can be used online only with a personalized account exclusively.

h4(#presentation). What is an online presentation?

An online presentation is a presentation possibility for images. It can be utilized only with images from the work folder. Your own images can not be used. The online presentation can be used only online with a personalized account.

h4(#projektor). What is the projektor + editor?

The projektor + editor is an independent program, that can be downloaded to use freely for the presentation of images in lectures and in class: "tools - programs":<%=r 'tools/programs/projektor-editor' %>.

The *projektor* shows the lecture which was created in the editor with single picture set-ups, direct selection, selection of text and enlargements.
With the *editor* downloaded images can be collected and sorted like on a light-table. This is possible also without a personal account.

Infosheet "Generation of an image presentation with editor and projector" - "download: tools - reference manuals (eikonline 3)":<%=r 'tools/manuals/eikonline-3' %>

h4(#offline). How can I establish a presentation in an off-line way?

You can establish a presentation with the "projektor + editor":<%=r 'tools/programs/projektor-editor' %> in an off-line way. You can download images from prometheus and establish a presentation with the projector. Here you can also include your own images.
You can establish a presentation also with Power-Point or other presentation programs off-line. For this purpose download the images and add them to the program. Here you can also include your own images.

h4(#ilias). What is ILIAS?

ILIAS is an online study- and teaching-platform. With ILIAS teachers can create E-Learning course materials, establish online tests for examinations and carry out virtual classes or lectures. The access is possible from every internet-capable computer. The registration for a guest account can be applied for online. If you need further rights, please turn to our "office":mailto:info@prometheus-bildarchiv.de.

h3(#data-supply). Supplying images

h4(#upload). We would like to upload our pictures in prometheus. What are the first steps?

First of all you create an own database.

Then there are several possibilities how your database can be uploaded.

1. Please send us a XML-dump with the contents and the image files and we reserve your data on the prometheus-Server.
2. You provide us with a XML-dump with the contents but keep the image files on your own server. In this case you are responsible for the access to your own server.

Further possibilities and options can be acquired through our office (see also "Information for database suppliers":<%=r 'databases' %>).

h4(#digitalize). We intend to digitalize our slides. Is that recommended?

Basically it is not recommended, because most slides were photographed from books. A digital image is often much better. Only original slides with views and objects which are not found in books should be scanned.
